# Visualizing the Titanic Dataset Using Tableau

## Overview
This project focuses on visualizing the Titanic dataset using Tableau to analyze various aspects of the passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset includes information about the passengers, such as their **age**, **sex**, **embarkation port**, **passenger class**, **ticket fare**, and whether they **survived** the disaster. The goal of this visualization is to provide insights into the factors that influenced survival rates on the Titanic.

## Data Source
The data used in this project is publicly available and can be downloaded from the following source:
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

The dataset contains the following columns:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, or 3rd)
- **Name**: Name of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
- **Ticket**: Ticket number
- **Fare**: Passenger ticket price
- **Cabin**: Cabin number
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Project Structure
The Tableau workbook contains the following sheets and dashboards:
1. **Train Count Across Age Bins**: A visualization showing the count of passengers across different age bins.
2. **Survival Analysis by Passenger ID**: A detailed analysis of survival status by passenger identifier (PassengerId).
3. **Passenger Travel Class Allocation**: A breakdown of passengers according to their travel class (1st, 2nd, and 3rd).
4. **Comparing Ticket Prices Between Male and Female Passengers**: A comparison of ticket prices between male and female passengers.
5. **Survival Analysis by Boarding Port**: An analysis of survival rates based on the boarding port (Cherbourg, Queenstown, Southampton).

## Insights
This analysis aims to explore the following:
- The relationship between **passenger class** and survival rates.
- The survival patterns based on **gender** and **age**.
- How **embarkation port** influenced the chances of survival.
- The impact of **ticket price** on survival.
